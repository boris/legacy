SVN manage scripts

* upate_remote is a script that allows you to update a remote staging server. For example, if you have your code on 'code.example.com' and your staging server on 'rc.example.com', you can keep up to date rc.example.com with this script.

* svn_backup creates backups (using svn dump) of your repository and then store it on a remote backup server. To save space on repository server, it also delete .dump file after success transfer
