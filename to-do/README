To-Do

"To-do" is a nice "to-do" list for Linux systems. I have tested it on many versions of Ubuntu (since 10.04 to 12.04) and it works great.

1. Requirements

    - Conky: http://conky.sourceforge.net
    - Text file used as list

2. Configuration

    Create (touch) a file to be used as todo list:
    $ touch ~/todo.txt

    Edit 'todo' and 'todone' and set $TODO with the path to the file you just touched.

    Add following line to your .conkyrc:
    ${execi 2 cat ~/todo.txt}

    This line is also on following gist: https://gist.github.com/3896791
3. Install
    
    $ chmod +x todo todone
    $ ln -s todo /usr/local/bin/todo
    $ ln -s todone /usr/local/bin/todone

4. Usage
    
    $ todo buy mil
    $ todone <ID>
